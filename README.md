Foolproof HTML prototype editor <https://pumpula.net/foolproof-html>

Good enough for demos, but not really usable yet. Mac only for now, mainly because doing good multi platform keyboard support would take time off from making the app actually work. Contributions welcome!

## Running

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

Built with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io).
